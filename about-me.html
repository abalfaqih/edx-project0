                My name is Ahmed. I was born many many years ago in this interesting city called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibam_Hadramawt" target="_blank">Shibam, in South Yemen then, or Yemen as it is known now.</a>
                It is interesting for many reasons. Some people call it the oldest sky scraper twon in the world. Others
                call it the Manahaten of the desert. It is also called the Yellow City, because it is always sunny. But
                the most interesting part of it is, most houses are linked to each other via a secret door. This way, women do
                not have to leave the house to visit their neighbours. They just go through the secret door and avoid
                having to climb down and up 5 floors or more on foot (ther are no lifts in these buildings). The other interesing
                part is that all of the houses are made of mud. These building stood the tests of times for over 300
                years. Rain or shine. They stood tall and strong, but non are taller than Trump Tower<br>
                Currently, and have been for the last 25 years, I have been living in two cities mainly, Singapore and Malaysia. I shuttle beteen these two citis approximately twice a month by bus mainly. Each trip takes about 6 houts. <br>
                For the record, I left the city of Shibam town in 1973, and have never gone back.

            <h1>Why, Why, Why<br>
                Am I Taking This Course?
            </h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            At my age, I should be Netflixing, or just go the park for a walk. I may never even be looking for a job as a developer. Who wants to hire and old man? Besides, I already have a full-time job. And I say full time, I mean 16 hours a day job. Anyway, the reason I am taking this course is because I Want to develop the next big app. Something bigger than Facebook, YouTube and Twitter combined together. Can I do it? Of course not. Seriously, here are some reasons why I took this course. Yet another list. This list uses the <strong>ID</strong> selecter as requested in the project requirement. 
        </p>
        <ul id="bullet-image">
            <li>I like to learn all the time. Somehow learning is no difference from exercising. The first is for the brain, and the second for the body. </li>
            <li>I have many ideas for developing web applications all all the time. It is expensive to hire programmers just to see if the idea is worth it or not. So, why not I try to build my own web application one day. So, I took this course hoping that I will be able to do so </li>
            <li>I have subscribed to numerous online portals, and I took and completed many courses. eDX course are my last frontier. I want to be able to evealuated it in comparison to other courses that I took somewhere else. </li>
