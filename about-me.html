                Am I Taking This Course?
            </h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            At my age, I should be Netflixing, or just go the park for a walk. I may never even be looking for a job as a developer. Who wants to hire and old man? Besides, I already have a full-time job. And I say full time, I mean 16 hours a day job. Anyway, the reason I am taking this course is because I Want to develop the next big app. Something bigger than Facebook, YouTube and Twitter combined together. Can I do it? Of course not. Seriously, here are some reasons why I took this course. Yet another list. This list uses the <strong>ID</strong> selecter as requested in the project requirement.

        <ul id="bullet-image">
            <li>I like to learn all the time. Somehow learning is no difference from exercising. The first is for the brain, and the second for the body. </li>
            <li>I have many ideas for developing web applications all all the time. It is expensive to hire programmers just to see if the idea is worth it or not. So, why not I try to build my own web application one day. So, I took this course hoping that I will be able to do so </li>
            <li>I have subscribed to numerous online portals, and I took and completed many courses. eDX course are my last frontier. I want to be able to evealuated it in comparison to other courses that I took somewhere else. </li>
