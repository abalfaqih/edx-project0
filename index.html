            <h1>Lists!</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
            Lists, ordered or unordered are the unsung heroes of HTML. You can use them for many things, including as
            navigation menu. Did you know that? Not many people knew this. I knew that before anyone else. Hmmm, I sound
            like someone you probably know who he is. <br>
            Anyway, head of to see the different options for creating lists <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/list-group/" target="_blank">here</a> and copy one of
            the ready made lists by the folks at bootstrap. Just like I did.
        </p>

        <div>
            <un class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="about-me.html">About me</a></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="singsapore.html">Singapore</a></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="malaysia.html">Malaysia</a></li>

            <h1>Tables!</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            Everybody hates coding tables in HTML. Ok, may be not everybody. But I do. Too many tags, too many nestings.
            For what? For a simple table. There has to be an easier way to do tables in HTML. I hope I can live long
            enough to see a better and easier ways of doing tables. An alternative way to create table is to head <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/content/tables/" target="_blank">here</a> and copy one of the
            ready made tables by the folks at bootstrap. Just like I did.
