                Welcome to Shibam. I was born many many years ago in this interesting city called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibam_Hadramawt" target="_blank">Shibam, in South Yemen then, or Yemen as it is known now.</a>
                It is interesting for many reasons. Some people call it the oldest sky scraper twon in the world. Others
                call it the Manahaten of the desert. It is also called the Yellow City, because it is always sunny. But
                the most interesting part of it is, most houses are linked to each other via a secret door. This way, women do
                not have to leave the house to visit their neighbours. They just go through the secret door and avoid
                having to climb down and up 5 floors or more on foot (ther are no lifts in these buildings). The other interesing
                part is that all of the houses are made of mud. These building stood the tests of times for over 300
                years. Rain or shine. They stood tall and strong, but non are taller than Trump Tower<br>
                Currently, and have been for the last 25 years, I have been living in two cities mainly, Singapore and Malaysia. I shuttle beteen these two citis approximately twice a month by bus mainly. Each trip takes about 6 hours. <br>
                For the record, I left the city of Shibam town in 1973, and have never gone back.

        <header>
            <h1>Lists!</h1>
        </header>

        <p>
            Lists, ordered or unordered are the unsung heroes of HTML. You can use them for many things, including as
            navigation menu. Did you know that? Not many people knew this. I knew that before anyone else. Hmmm, I sound
            like someone you probably know who he is. <br>
            Anyway, head of to see the different options for creating lists <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/list-group/" target="_blank">here</a> and copy one of
            the ready made lists by the folks at bootstrap. Just like I did.
        </p>

        <div>
            <un class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="about-me.html">About me</a></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="singapore.html">Singapore</a></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="kl.html">Kuala Lumpur</a></li>
            </un>
        </div>

        <header>
            <h1>Tables!</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            Everybody hates coding tables in HTML. Ok, may be not everybody. But I do. Too many tags, too many nestings.
            For what? For a simple table. There has to be an easier way to do tables in HTML. I hope I can live long
            enough to see a better and easier ways of doing tables. An alternative way to create table is to head <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/content/tables/" target="_blank">here</a> and copy one of the
            ready made tables by the folks at bootstrap. Just like I did.
